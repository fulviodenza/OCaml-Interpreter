# Ocaml-Interpreter
Project of UniPi for an Ocaml Interpreter

OLD: (*** This is a project committed for the second part of UniPi's Programming 2
The code reflect the Ocaml semantic and syntax with the main constructs adding
the Dictionary construct with operations defined on this, like defining a 
dictionary, adding elements, clear a dictionary or remove elements.
To do this we have to return expressible values which will be evaluated as
dictionary, in this case, and will be ready to do another operation on the
dictionary. ***)

NEW: This project begun as Programming II project, now I'm gonna implement
Classes and Objects in this interpreter to extend it's usage.
